This is the ReadMe file for this project

The source code for this project does not include the necessary node-modules files,
and does not include the amplify files needed in order to use Amplify functions. 

I will post npm commands or Amplify documentation links here as I come across/remember them, but the files are too large for me to upload here. 
Thanks for reading this, and feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
