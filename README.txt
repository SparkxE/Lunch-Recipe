This is the ReadMe file for this project

The source code for this project does not include the necessary node-modules files,
and does not include the amplify files needed in order to use Amplify functions. 

Please make sure that you have the Expo CLI installed instead of the Global Expo CLI as the Global version
has been deprecated by Expo and is not being used for this project. 

I will post npm commands or Amplify documentation links here as I come across/remember them, but the
node_modules & amplify files are too large for me to upload here. 
Thanks for reading this, and feel free to let me know if you have any questions. 


- NPM Commands - 
npm install expo (if not done already)
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
amplify pull --appId d1r8yxn6bpd03v --envName dev (this pulls the Amplify environment down into your local machine)

- AWS Documentation & Tutorials -
